## Features
- **Outer Exploration**: Promote international collaboration in space exploration and technologies to understand our universe and protect Earth from cosmic threats.
- **Inner Exploration**: Foster tools and methodologies like meditation, contemplation, and psychedelics (when used responsibly) to explore human consciousness and its potential.
- **Redirection of Resources**: Highlight pathways for transitioning from conflict-driven industries and efforts to research and innovation that benefit humanity.
- **Interactive Thought Experiments**: Engage users in reflecting on their potential contributions to exploration and redirection of resources through interactive elements.
